	1.	Add the missing intent ask_weather to the domain.yml.
	2.	Make sure all the intents defined in nlu.yml are also listed in the domain.yml.

# How it works

	1.	Intent Recognition: Rasa’s NLU model first identifies the user’s intent (e.g., greet, ask_weather).
	2.	Policy Decision: Rasa Core checks the defined stories and rules to decide which action to trigger based on the identified intent.
	3.	Action Execution: Rasa either sends a predefined response (like utter_greet) or triggers a custom action (like action_weather) based on the intent.


    Example of How It Works:

Scenario:

	•	The user says: “What’s the weather in New York?”
	•	Rasa detects the ask_weather intent and extracts location: New York.

Based on the Rule or Story:

	•	The ask_weather intent triggers the custom action action_weather (as defined in the rules or stories).
	•	The action_weather custom action runs, fetching weather information for “New York” and responding to the user.

Recap of Key Points:

	•	Domain File (domain.yml): Defines the available intents, actions, slots, and responses, but does not map intents directly to actions.
	•	Stories File (stories.yml): Provides multi-turn conversation mappings (intent → action sequence).
	•	Rules File (rules.yml): Provides direct, single-turn intent → action mappings.
	•	Custom Actions (actions.py): Handles complex logic when triggered by certain intents (e.g., fetching weather data).
